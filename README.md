C# library that allows you to easily create terraced terrain like the godus game.

The main goal is to deliver functions that I use a lot and that are very useful in my procedural generation projects.

## Usage

You can use this library in your Unity game by using the `Package Manager` and select `Add package from git url` and copy git url of this repo into it.

```C#
using Unity.Mathematics;
using Saitama.TerracedTerrain;

namespace MyNamespace
{
    ...

    // Need some eg...

    ...
}
```
